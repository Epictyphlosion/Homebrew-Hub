# Disclaimer
This repository is dedicated to preserving many homebrew ROMs from the scene that the community has created.
I don't want to censor these ROMs as doing so would be like saying that they never ever existed at one point.
Some of these ROMs may be offensive. If you don't want to see things like that, please don't look at them. Thank you!

# Homebrew-Museum
A collection of WAYYYYY to many legal, homebrew ROMs for use on RetroPie, Flashcarts, or Emulators.

## Why?
Because the homebrew scene is great and I would like to see what has been created to exist forever.
