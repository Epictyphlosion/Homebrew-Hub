# Disclaimer
This repository is dedicated to preserving many homebrew ROMs from the scene that the community has created.
Some of these ROMs may be offensive. If you don't want to see things like that, please don't look at them. Thank you!
I don't want to censor these ROMs as doing so would be like saying that they never ever existed at one point.

# Homebrew-Museum
A collection of WAYYYYY to many legal, homebrew ROMs for use on RetroPie, Flashcarts, or Emulators.

## Why?
Because the homebrew scene is great and I would like to see what has been created to exist forever. 

## How?
Several Years of being in the homebrew scene, and also many hours of looking on sites with stuff to preserve.
