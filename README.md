# Disclaimer
This repository is dedicated to preserving many homebrew ROMs from the scene that the community has created.
Some of these ROMs may be offensive. I don't want to censor these ROMs as doing so would be like saying that they 
never ever existed at one point. If you don't want to see things like that, please don't look at them. Thank you!

# Homebrew-Hub
A collection of WAYYYYY to many legal, homebrew ROMs for use on RetroPie, Flashcarts, or Emulators.

## Why?
Because the homebrew scene is great and I would like to see what has been created to exist forever. 

## How?
Several Years of being in the homebrew scene, and also many hours of looking on sites with stuff to preserve.

## TODO
- Bally Astrocade
- Atari 5200
- Atari ST
- MS-DOS
- Microsoft Windows
- Add the Game Boy ROMs from freeroms.com
